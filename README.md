# NFA-to-DFA-Converter-Final-Project
Introduction
This Haskell project provides a tool to convert Non-deterministic Finite Automatons (NFAs) into Deterministic Finite Automatons (DFAs). It's designed to be user-friendly and efficient, leveraging Haskell's functional programming capabilities for optimal performance.

Features
Convert NFA to DFA: Transforms any given NFA into its equivalent DFA.
Haskell Efficiency: Utilizes Haskell's functional programming features for concise and effective processing.
Cabal Packaging: Easy to build and install using Haskell's Cabal package manager.
